# cabbagebot

Cabbagebot is a Discord bot that spreads the joy of cabbage.

### Installation

Clone cabbagebot, then run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Setup

You'll need to set up a Discord bot and get a Flickr API key to use cabbagebot.

I'm not going to explain the setup processes for either of these things, as
they are documented elsewhere. Once you have the discord token, place it in a
file in this directory called "discord_token". Same idea for the Flickr API key,
but it should be placed at "flickr_api_key".

More detailed instructions maybe coming soon. Maybe.
